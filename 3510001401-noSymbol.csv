2016-03-31T04:00:00Z,"On March 31, 2016, the provincial and territorial total for total custodial admissions, total sentenced admissions and total remand admissions for 2014-2015 were corrected."

Footnotes:
1,"This product is based on data from the Adult Correctional Services Survey (ACS), the Integrated Correctional Services Survey (ICSS) and the Canadian Correctional Services Survey (CCSS). The ACS, the ICSS and CCSS are administered by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (Statistics Canada) in collaboration with adult provincial/territorial and federal correctional systems responsible for correctional services in Canada. These surveys collect statistical information on the delivery of adult correctional services and provide important indicators as to the nature and characteristics of correctional case-flow."
2,"The Adult Correctional Services Survey (ACS) is an aggregate survey whose reporting jurisdictions currently include: Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Manitoba, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The Integrated Correctional Services Survey (ICSS) is a microdata survey which supplies data to the ACS. Reporting jurisdictions currently include: Newfoundland and Labrador (Adult), Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Correctional Service Canada. The Canadian Correctional Services Survey (CCSS) is a new microdata survey being implemented to replace the ICSS. Reporting jurisdictions currently include: Saskatchewan, Alberta (adult) and British Columbia. Data for Alberta are not available from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016. For all Canadian Correctional Services Survey and Integrated Correctional Services Survey data respondents, comparisons to data prior to their implementation to the microdata survey should be made with caution. Data are based on a fiscal year (April 1 through March 31). Due to rounding, figures may not add to totals. These data are administrative data. Although the surveys attempt to standardize the way in which data are reported, limitations due to differences among jurisdictional operations may restrict uniform application of the definitions in some situations. For this reason, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of the data should be made with caution."
3,"On March 31, 2016, the provincial and territorial total for total custodial admissions, total sentenced admissions and total remand admissions for 2014-2015 were corrected."
4,"Admissions are counted each time a person begins any period of supervision in a correctional institution or in the community. These data describe and measure the flow of persons through correctional services over time. The same person may be included several times in the admission counts where he/she moves from one correctional program to another (e.g., from remand to sentenced custody) or re-enters the system later in the same year. Admissions therefore represent the number of entries of persons, during a fiscal year, to remand, sentenced custody or a community supervision program, regardless of the previous legal status."
5,Provincial and territorial sentenced admissions include provincial and territorial inmate admissions as well as federal inmates admitted to the provincial and territorial system prior to being transferred to a federal penitentiary.
6,The total does not necessarily represent all provinces and territories as there are variations in the availability of data for certain jurisdictions and years. Comparison among years at the national level should be made with caution. Detailed data availability information can be found in the notes associated to the provinces or territories.
7,Newfoundland and Labrador began reporting to the Integrated Correctional Services Survey in 2001/2002. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution. Remand admission data exclude remands involving short periods of incarceration as these are managed by the RCMP. Other custodial status admissions data for 2000/2001 are not available.
8,"In Prince Edward Island, all data for 2004/2005 to 2006/2007; and, other custodial status admissions data prior to 2012/2013 are not available."
9,Nova Scotia began reporting to the Integrated Correctional Services Survey in 2002/2003. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution.
10,"New Brunswick began reporting to the Integrated Correctional Services Survey in 2002/2003. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution. Prior to 2002/2003, only those offenders who were admitted and released during the calendar year are represented in sentenced admissions by sex, Aboriginal identity, and median age on admission. Custodial admission data for 2000/2001 are not available."
11,Ontario began reporting to the Integrated Correctional Services Survey in 2003/2004. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution.
12,"As of 2011/2012, data on the fine option program is not available for Manitoba."
13,"Saskatchewan began reporting to the Integrated Correctional Services Survey in 2001/2002. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution. As of 2015/2016, community service, restitution and electronic monitoring are considered to be either probation or conditional sentence admissions, depending on the type of order with which they are associated. Previously, they were considered stand-alone legal statuses. Saskatchewan began reporting to the Canadian Correctional Services Survey in 2016/2017. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution."
14,"Up to 2011/2012, Alberta used a different counting methodology whereby an admission to custody is counted once, regardless of change in status. The Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS) methodology counts an admission as a movement from one status in correctional services to another. For instance, an individual who moves from remand to sentenced custody will be counted as one admission to remand and one admission to sentenced custody. As a result, the number of admissions reported by CCJS are higher than the number of admissions reported by Alberta between 2005/2006 and 2011/2012. Admissions to custody data prior to 2005/2006 have been excluded due to a system change that occurred in 2005/2006, which altered the methodology by which admissions to custody were calculated. From 2016/2017, Alberta reports admissions data through a new data collection vehicle, the Canadian Correctional Services Survey (CCSS), and is able to report admissions data as per the standard CCJS methodology. Data from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016 and custodial admissions data by median age for all reference periods and other custodial status admissions up to 2011/2012 are not available. Alberta began reporting community supervision data to the Integrated Correctional Services Survey in 2003/2004. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution."
15,"British Columbia began reporting to the Integrated Correctional Services Survey in 2008/2009. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution. British Columbia migrated to a new data collection platform called the Canadian Correctional Services Survey (CCSS) from 2016/2017. The CCSS implemented new methodologies which may result in a small increase in custody admissions from previous years. In British Columbia, sentenced admissions counts include immigration holds prior to 2008/2009. Other custodial status admissions represent pre-court lock-ups in a correctional facility. Other custodial status admissions data from 2005/2006 to 2007/2008 are not available. British Columbia began reporting to the Canadian Correctional Services Survey in 2016/2017. Comparisons to data from previous years should be made with caution."
16,The Northwest Territories began reporting community admissions data in 2009/2010. Other custodial status admissions are not available as of from 2007/2008. Community admissions data are not available prior to 2009/2010.
17,"Nunavut did not have an inmate data system available to properly calculate any custodial admission data for 2000/2001 (in order to calculate sentence length distributions and medians, and sentenced admissions by median age on admission). Other custodial status admissions for all years are not available. Community admissions data are not available for 2000/2001."
18,"Total custodial admissions are totals of sentenced (including intermittent sentences), remand and other custodial status admissions."
19,"Sentenced custody is the detention of offenders convicted of a crime, either in a federal (two years or more), or a provincial/territorial (less than two years) facility. Sentenced custody admissions include admissions to intermittent sentences."
20,"Remand is the detention of a person in custody while awaiting a further court appearance. These persons have not been sentenced and can be held for a number of reasons (e.g., risk that they won't appear for their court date, danger to themselves and/or others, risk to re-offend). Remand is the responsibility of provincial/territorial correctional services."
21,"Other custodial statuses include persons who are being held in provincial/territorial correctional institutions for lock-ups, parole violations or suspensions, immigration holds, and those who are temporarily detained without warrants of any type."
22,"Probation orders are dispositions imposed by the Court that are a non-custodial sentence. The offender is released into the community under the supervision of a probation officer. The release is conditional on the offender acting in a manner stipulated by the Court. Probation is mandatory when the accused is given a suspended sentence or a conditional discharge. For those jurisdictions that do not operate a provincial or territorial parole board (i.e. all but Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia (until March 31, 2007)), the probation caseload may also include a small number of provincial or territorial parolees. Probation is supervised by provincial/territorial correctional services."
23,"Conditional sentence of imprisonment option came into effect in September 1996. When a conditional sentence is imposed, the offender serves their sentence in the community under supervision. The prerequisites for imposing a conditional sentence include: the offence must not have a prescribed minimum sentence; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for the offence must be less than two years; and the court must be satisfied that the offender would not endanger the safety of the community. The offender who receives such a conditional sentence of imprisonment must abide by certain conditions, such as ""house arrest"", curfew, alcohol or driving prohibition, treatment programs or a community service order, and may be sent to prison if he or she violates those conditions. Conditional sentences are supervised by provincial/territorial correctional services."
